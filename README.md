# how_many_cells

Using the negative binomial and binomial distribution to model single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) random sampling.

For clarification on how these sampling distributions work, visit: https://github.com/okhosrav/distributions

The model addresses two questions: how many cells do I need to sequence in order to detect a certain rare cell type with a known abundance? How many cells of a rare cell type will I detect if I sequence a fixed number of cells. The answers of these questions will be critical for informing scRNA-seq experiments. Two examples are provided in the context of cells from the mouse colon.
